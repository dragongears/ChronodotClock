# ChronodotClock

A Peggy 2 digital clock that uses a Chronodot to keep time. See this Evil Mad Scientist post for details on adding a Chronodot to a Peggy 2: [Peggy 2: Adding a ChronoDot](http://www.evilmadscientist.com/2010/peggy-2-adding-a-chronodot/)

This program is based on my original Peggy 2 Digital Clock program which is also available on GitHub at [Peggy 2 Digital Clock](https://github.com/dragongears/Peggy-2-Digital-Clock)
and it uses the [Arduino-Chronodot library](https://github.com/Stephanie-Maks/Arduino-Chronodot)
